                                    User interface design is the field of study that tries to understand how
                                    people use products such as software, machines and electronic devices and try to improve upon its usabilty through it interface to improve user experience and effeciency of use. User interface design is a multidisciplinary field with many facets and requiring expertise of personel from various backgrounds such as engineers, designers, software engineers and psychologists.

                                    <p>According to wikipedia the free encyclopedia an algorithm is a well defined set of steps that typically solves a problem or some form of computation. Algorithms are very powerful tools in this computerized age and even then they existed before digital computers, a famous algorithm, the Euclidean algorithm was formulated during the acient Greek times and is still relevant even to this day. Since hardware have physical limitations it is becoming ever more evident that algorithms will be the direction we take in improving computation perfomance.

                            <p >My name is keemo yen and I am a final year computer science student, I am buildning this blog
                            for my INFO-2180 course lab. It was a bit challenging but I'am excited to learn all these powerful
                            tools which will certainly improve my career prospects in the near term future.</p>
